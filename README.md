# Notes for James Donaldson 

1. Display needs to be updated still, if you want to work on that that would be awesome!
2. Optimization should be further improved
3. My comments fucking suck so I'll add more
4. Do the makefile on the server whenever you submit

5. Most importantly, we still must do our write up for the project after you are done with testing

**Also! If you want to make a branch for this whenever you pull no prob Or just commit directly to the main branch. Either way is fine.
